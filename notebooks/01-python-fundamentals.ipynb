    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's designed to be easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Python like English among programming languages – it's relatively easy to understand, widely spoken (used), and gets the job done without unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python for Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become the **#1 language for data science** for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Easy to learn** - Clean, readable syntax that looks almost like plain English\n",
    "2. **Powerful libraries** - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and more\n",
    "3. **Large community** - Millions of developers, endless tutorials and resources\n",
    "4. **Industry adoption** - Used by Google, Netflix, Meta, banks, and research institutions\n",
    "5. **Versatility** - From web development to machine learning to automation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data analyst or data scientist, you'll spend most of your time:\n",
    "- Cleaning and transforming data\n",
    "- Performing statistical analysis\n",
    "- Creating visualizations\n",
    "- Building predictive models\n",
    "\n",
    "Python makes all of these tasks efficient and enjoyable. The skills you learn here will directly apply to your data career."

    "- **Markdown cells** - Where you write formatted text, explanations, and notes\n",
    "- **Output** - Results appear directly below each code cell\n",

    "# Module Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Python & Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- Python is the #1 language for data science due to its simplicity and powerful libraries\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks combine code, output, and documentation in one interactive document\n",
    "- Use `print()` to display output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Variables and Data Types\n",
    "- Variables store data using the `variable = value` syntax\n",
    "- Four main types: `int` (whole numbers), `float` (decimals), `str` (text), `bool` (True/False)\n",
    "- Use `type()` to check a variable's data type\n",
    "- Use descriptive, meaningful variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Operators\n",
    "- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`\n",
    "- **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`\n",
    "- **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Strings\n",
    "- Create with single or double quotes\n",
    "- Use indexing `[0]` and slicing `[start:end]` to access parts\n",
    "- Common methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.split()`, `.replace()`, `.find()`\n",
    "- Format with f-strings: `f\"Hello, {name}!\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Input and Type Conversion\n",
    "- `input()` gets user input (always returns a string)\n",
    "- Convert types with `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`\n",
    "- Always convert input before doing math\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Comments\n",
    "- Single-line: `# comment`\n",
    "- Multi-line: `\"\"\"docstring\"\"\"`\n",
    "- Good comments explain **why**, not just **what**\n",
    "- Document your data analysis for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Module 2: Data Structures**, we'll learn about:\n",
    "- **Lists** - Ordered collections of items\n",
    "- **Tuples** - Immutable sequences\n",
    "- **Dictionaries** - Key-value pairs for structured data\n",
    "- **Sets** - Collections of unique items\n",
    "\n",
    "These data structures are essential for organizing and manipulating data in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "For extra practice, try these challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temperature Converter**: Create a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Ask the user which conversion they want, get the temperature, and display the result with proper formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple Interest Calculator**: Calculate simple interest given principal, rate, and time. Formula: Interest = Principal × Rate × Time. Display both the interest and the final amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Email Parser**: Given an email address, extract and display:\n",
    "   - The username (before @)\n",
    "   - The domain (after @)\n",
    "   - Whether it's a .com, .org, or other domain\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Summary Generator**: Create variables for a dataset (name, rows, columns, file size in MB, date created). Generate a formatted summary report with proper documentation."
