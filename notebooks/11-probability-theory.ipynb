    "## What are Sample Spaces and Events?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. An **event** is a subset of the sample space - a collection of one or more outcomes we're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when rolling a six-sided die, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. An event might be \"rolling an even number,\" which corresponds to the subset {2, 4, 6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding sample spaces and events is the foundation of probability theory. In data science, we use these concepts to model uncertainty in customer behavior, financial markets, medical diagnoses, and countless other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world data science, you'll often need to calculate the probability of specific outcomes. For instance, what's the probability that a customer will click on an ad? What's the chance that a transaction is fraudulent? These questions all start with defining the sample space and the events of interest."

    "- **Sample spaces and events** form the foundation of probability, helping us model and calculate the likelihood of outcomes\n",
    "- **Conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem** allow us to update probabilities based on new information, essential for classification and diagnosis\n",
    "- **Random variables** (discrete and continuous) provide a mathematical framework for modeling uncertainty in data\n",
    "- **Probability distributions** (Binomial, Poisson, Normal) are patterns that appear repeatedly in real-world data\n",
    "- **Expected value and variance** quantify central tendency and risk, crucial for decision-making under uncertainty\n",
    "- **Central Limit Theorem** is the bridge between sample statistics and population parameters, enabling statistical inference\n",
    "- **Joint and marginal distributions** help analyze relationships between multiple variables\n",
    "- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** provides a principled method for fitting probability models to data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 15: Advanced Statistics, we'll build on probability theory to explore statistical inference, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and the differences between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches. You'll learn how to make data-driven decisions with quantified uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "For extra practice, try these challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Risk Analysis**: A product has a 2% defect rate. If you sample 200 units, what's the probability of finding more than 5 defects? Use the Binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bayes in Action**: Implement a spam filter using Bayes' Theorem. Given that 30% of emails are spam, and the word \"FREE\" appears in 80% of spam but only 10% of legitimate emails, calculate P(Spam | contains \"FREE\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CLT Simulation**: Simulate rolling a die 1000 times with different sample sizes (n=5, 10, 30, 50). Plot the distribution of sample means for each and observe when the CLT takes effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customer Segmentation**: Create a joint distribution for customer age groups and product categories. Calculate marginal distributions and test for independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **MLE Challenge**: Generate 100 data points from a normal distribution with unknown parameters. Use MLE to estimate both the mean and standard deviation, then compare to the true values you used to generate the data."
